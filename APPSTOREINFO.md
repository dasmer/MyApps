MyApps does not collect, use, or share any user data.

The app uses Apple's public iTunes Search API to fetch publicly available app and developer information. This data is displayed to the user and is not stored, transmitted, or shared.

No analytics, no tracking, no advertisements, no third-party SDKs.
